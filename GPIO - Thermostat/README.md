### Project 1: Thermostat (Using CC3220 LaunchPad and Code Composer Studio in C)

#### Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
- The project involves creating a thermostat system that controls a light based on room temperature and a setpoint temperature that can be changed up or down based on two buttons on either side of the board.

#### What did you do particularly well?
- I think I debugged the code really well.
- I also really like syntax and commenting each line so people know my thought process as well as understanding if I messed up with my thinking, so they can then fix it or let me know.

#### Where could you improve?
- I'm sure there are a thousand different things that I could do to improve my project.
- I could make the buttons be able to be held down, so they continuously increase instead of having to do it one at a time.
- I could design some hardware in which I could contain the board so it's safe
- Or I could also set it up to an external digital counter to show the temp and what its set to.

#### What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
- I used Code Composer Studio and a CC3220 launchpad board by TI as well as the C language.

#### What skills from these projects will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or coursework?
- I wasn't the best at programming in C, but this definetely helped me better understand it and what it can do.
- It also helped me understand how I can now work on hardware projects (something I've always wanted to do) for my portfolio or fun.

#### How did you make these projects maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
- I tried to make the code pretty simple and use as little lines as possible.
- I also commented on every line for this project and I beleive that helped me understand it and helped anyone else that will look at it understand as well.
